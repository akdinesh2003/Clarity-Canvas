# **App Name**: Clarity Canvas

## Core Features:

- Layout Testing: Provides a clean canvas to test different layouts without interference from saved history or clutter. It can 'remember' its layout across different incognito sessions using browser storage, acting as a tool in case layout tests have different lengths.
- Demo Lock Screen Flows: Allows demonstration of lock screen flows in client meetings without exposing prior work.
- Simulate First-Time User Experience: Enables simulation of 'first-time user' experiences with zero residual data.
- Rapid Prototyping: Facilitates quick prototyping and discarding of ideas without polluting localStorage.
- Secure Mode: Offers a secure mode to hide notifications until unlocked, enhancing privacy during demonstrations.
- Feedback Pins: Incorporates feedback pins for collaborative review, allowing users to mark specific areas for feedback.
- Export Tools: Provides export tools to save essential work and discard the rest, ensuring nothing important is lost.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#64B5F6) to reflect clarity and experimentation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) for a clean and unobtrusive canvas.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A5D6A7) for positive feedback and action items.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' sans-serif for body text and 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headings, ensuring readability and a tech-forward feel.
- Use simple, outlined icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Maintain a minimalist layout with ample whitespace to focus on the prototype. The export functionality should use subtle cues that appear when the user intends to leave the page with unsaved work.
- Use subtle, smooth transitions for UI elements to provide a polished feel without being distracting.
